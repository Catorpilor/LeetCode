###[Unique Binary Search Trees][qurl]
## Analysis
  - Using DP
  - Binary Search Trees have fixed format that is root is larger than its chile subtrees and smaller than its right child subtree;
  - 1...n given the fixed root k then its combiantion is T[k] * T[n-k]
  

## Solutions
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numTrees(int n) {
        vector<int> trees(n+1,0);
        trees[0] = 1;
        for( int i =1; i<=n; ++i){
            for( int j =0; j<i;++j) {
                trees[i] += trees[j] * trees[i-j-1];
            }
        }
        return trees[n];
    }
};
```
